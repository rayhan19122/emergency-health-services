## 2. Super Admin — Platform Setup

After logging in as Super Admin, you land on the **Platform Administration** dashboard.

### 2.1 Load Demo Data

If the platform has **no organizations**, a yellow card appears:

2. This seeds the database with sample Dhaka-based facilities:

| Type | Organizations Added |
|------|-------------------|
| Hospitals | Dhaka Medical College, Square Hospital, United Hospital, Labaid Hospital |
| Blood Banks | Sandhani Blood Bank, Bangladesh Red Crescent Blood Centre |
| Ambulance Operators | Dhaka Ambulance Service, Emergency Rescue BD, LifeLine Ambulance |

Each comes pre-loaded with beds, blood stock, ambulance vehicles, and diagnostic tests.

> 💡 You can skip demo data and add everything manually instead (see below).

---

### 2.2 Add an Organization Manually

**Navigate:** Platform Dashboard → **Manage Organizations** → **Add Organization** button (top right)

Fill in the form:

Click **Add** — the organization is created as **Verified** immediately.

> 🔑 After adding, you must also **assign an admin user** to manage it (see [2.3](#23-assign-admin-roles-to-users)).

---

### 2.3 Assign Admin Roles to Users

**Navigate:** Platform Dashboard → **Manage Users**

1. Find the user by name or email in the list
2. Click the **edit (pencil) icon** on their row
3. In the dialog:
   - **Role dropdown** — select the admin type:
     - `Hospital Admin` — for hospitals
     - `Blood Bank Admin` — for blood banks
     - `Ambulance Admin` — for ambulance operators
   - **Organization dropdown** — appears after selecting a role; pick the organization they'll manage (only shows matching organizations — e.g., hospital admins see only hospitals)
4. Click **Save**

The user will see their admin dashboard on their next page load.

> 📋 You can also set someone as `Super Admin` or revert them to `Patient` from this same dialog.
