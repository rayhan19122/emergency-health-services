  // every Firestore read hang forever even though plain HTTPS works. Long
  // polling uses ordinary HTTP requests, so reads succeed everywhere. This
  // matters for an emergency app used on unpredictable networks/devices.

  // the IndexedDB cache can stall collection queries in restricted/multi-tab
  // environments, and the app always wants fresh data anyway.
